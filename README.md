# Dementia (aka: Arena) 

A top down level based arena shooter game I made for college back in '07 

I was digging around an old hard drive today (2024-05-09) and came across the source code and game distributable, and thought I'd upload it here.

Heavily inspired by this much older indie game a friend of mine and I found simply called "Krieg" and of course Smash TV, this project came about because a college class called "User Interface 100" which was basically "intro to flash" was something I could have challenged out of, but decided to ask my professor for a different idea: I'd spend the entire semester making a big game project in Flash to deliver.  He agreed after I showed him I had been using Flash since v5 dropped back in ye ol' newgrounds days.  What I didn't anticipate was how brutal that semester was going to be for the other classes, but I persevered anyways. A friend of mine came aboard during the last bit to help me fix some bugs and decided to stay on and help out with some features instead.  Was it cheating? Perhaps. But by this time I had already demonstrated to my professor that I was capable of accomplishing what the course criteria needed anyways so he was fine with it.  By the end of the term, it was looking pretty sweet but it ran like garbage and when Flash games run like garbage all kinds of mayhem start happening.  During the final night of marathon development, we made the reluctant decision to take out the A* pathfinding so the game could run faster than 1fps (that's why the enemies just b-line straight for you and get stuck in the walls)  

Why was it called "Dementia"? Because I suck at naming things and the word gelled with me.  Look, 2007 was a different time. 

You don't need Flash to play this, it's bundled as an executable and I can confirm it definitely works on Windows 11.
